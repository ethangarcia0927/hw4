      <h3>What are Programming Languages?</h3>
      <p>
        Programming languages are tools that developers use to write instructions a computer can understand.
        These languages make it possible to create websites, apps, games, and artificial intelligence.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each language serves its own purpose. For example, <strong>Python</strong> is known for its simplicity,
        <strong>C++</strong> for performance, and <strong>JavaScript</strong> for web development.
